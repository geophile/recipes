Ingredients:

- Box of lasagna noodles
- 1 lb. ground beef
- 1 lb. sausage (sweet or spicy, your preference)
- Ricotta (1 lb. is way more than enough)
- Mozzarella, 1 lb.
- Diced tomatos, large can (28 oz)
- Tomato sauce, 14 oz
- Tomato paste, small can
- Yellow onion
- Garlic, if you'd like
- Olive oil

Toys:

- Large pan (sauce)
- Large pot (noodles)
- Large glass pan (final product)
- Strainer (noodles)

Cooking:

- Preheat oven to 350.

- Cut up the mozzarella into cubes.

- Dice the onion, pretty small.

- Chop the garlic, fine.

- Start boiling a large pot of water.

- In a large pan, heat up some olive oil, medium/high flame.

- Add the onion and garlic.

- When the onion is brown, add the beef and sausage.

- Keep turning and mixing the meat, you want it all mixed, and not
  clumped (as in the package)

- When the meat is cooked (no pink) add the tomato sauce and mix it
  in. Save a little of the tomato sauce to put on top of lasagna at
  the end, (optional).

- Keep cooking, adding tomato paste to thicken the sauce. Once the
  sauce is at the right consistency (whatever looks/tastes right),
  reduce the flame to low, just to keep things warm. Add salt if you'd
  like.

- While the meat is cooking, add the lasagna noodles to the water once
  it's boiling. Use the whole box, it will be a little more than you
  need.

- Use a paper towel to coat the glass pan with olive oil.

- Cover the bottom of the pan with 3-4 lasagna noodles. Overlap the
  edges a little, you want the bottom of the pan covered.

- Add half the sauce and spread it out.

- Add scoops of ricotta and chunks of mozzarella.

- Add the next layer of lasagna.

- More ricotta and mozzarella.

- Final layer of lasagna. Add a little tomato sauce on top, if you'd
  like.

- Cover with aluminum foil.

- Cook at 350 for 1/2 hour, or until the sauce is bubbling (visible
  through the pan).

- Remove the aluminum foil and cook for another five minutes.

- Take out of the oven, let sit for a while.
